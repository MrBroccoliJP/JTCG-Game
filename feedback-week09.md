# Great progress!

Your project is shaping up well, and there are some great additions to your codebase.

### What is good:
- **Javadoc Comments**: The inclusion of Javadoc comments is fantastic. It's a great way to document your code and make it easier for others (and your future self) to understand.
- **UML Integration**: Adding a UML diagram is an excellent touch, as it helps visualize the structure and relationships in your application.

### Where to improve:
1. **Graphics**:
   - Investing in better graphics could enhance the overall player experience. Consider polishing the design to make it more visually engaging.

2. **Snake Grid Boundary**:
   - Ensure the snake’s head does not appear outside the grid. This will improve the gameplay experience and maintain consistency.

3. **Packages**:
   - Always use lowercase letters for package names. This is a standard Java convention that helps with code organization and readability.

4. **Encapsulation**:
   - The `start()` method in the `BaseDifficulty` class could be further encapsulated. Breaking it into smaller, more focused methods would make it easier to maintain and debug.
   - Similarly, the `rainbowEffectManager()` method in the same class could use more encapsulation to improve readability and clarity.

5. **Loop Optimization**:
   - In the `HardDifficulty` class, consider using a `for` loop in the `configureOrbs()` method to create bad orbs. This approach could also be applied to the `configureOrbs()` methods in other difficulty levels, making the code more concise and consistent.

6. **Static Final Variables**:
   - The `CELLSIZE` variable in the `Game` class is a great candidate for a `static final` variable. This is because it remains constant throughout the game.  
     Example:  
     ```java
     public static final int CELL_SIZE = 20;
     ```  
     Remember, `static final` variables are written in uppercase, with words separated by underscores. You can reference them directly via the class name without needing an instance.

7. **Game Constructor**:
   - Revisit the constructor in the `Game` class. You’re creating a new screen that requires a score system, but it’s currently receiving a `null` value. Ensure the score system is properly initialized before being passed to the screen.

8. **Access Modifiers**:
   - Carefully review your access modifiers. Leaving them as the default (package-private) can come across as careless. Be intentional and use `private`, `protected`, or `public` where appropriate to control access.

9. **Magic Numbers**:
   - Avoid using "magic numbers" in your code—numbers that lack context or explanation. Instead, define them as variables with meaningful names.  
     For example:  
     ```java
     private static final int MAX_BAD_ORBS = 5;
     ```

10. **OrbManager Encapsulation**:
    - The `orbCheck()` method in the `OrbManager` class is too large. Break it into smaller methods to encapsulate conditions and improve the overall readability of your code.

### Additional Suggestions:
- **Keep Up the Momentum**: You’ve already done a great job with encapsulation and organizing your code. Keep applying these principles consistently throughout your project.  
- **UML Documentation**: Your UML diagram is a strong addition—continue to update it as your application evolves.

### Final Thoughts:
You’re making excellent progress on your Snake Arcade project. By addressing these points, you’ll make your code cleaner, more maintainable, and easier to scale. Keep up the fantastic work—you’re on the right track!
